# HANDOFF.md: Project Architecture, History, and Next Steps
**Version:** 1.6.0
**Date:** 2024-05-22

## Overview & State
The `hymn_remaker` project is an incredibly robust, automated AI pipeline for transforming public domain `.mid` files into modern, YouTube-ready music videos. It features parallel processing, Web UI, dynamic audio processing, and professional AI integrations (OpenAI, Replicate, ElevenLabs).

The codebase is highly functional, 100% stable, strictly typed, and completely modular.

## Core Features Implemented
1. **Web UI (`app.py`)**: Built with Streamlit (`port 8501`). Features two main tabs:
   - **Generate**: Handles multiple `.mid` file uploads. Validates the `MThd` MIDI byte signature instantly. Exposes sliders for Concurrency limits, Dropdowns for Style Presets, an expander for Audio Fading/Normalization, a checkbox to generate ElevenLabs Vocals, and a checkbox to use a dynamic FFmpeg visualizer over static DALL-E art.
   - **Gallery & History**: Reads from a local `sqlite3` database (`history.db`) to display, play, and provide download links for previously generated MP4s, WAVs, and JSON metadata.
2. **Parallel Pipeline (`main.py`)**: Uses `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` (capped at 4 workers to prevent API rate limits). It securely passes the `streamlit.runtime.scriptrunner.add_script_run_ctx` down to the threads so progress updates stream back to the UI in real-time.
3. **Audio Mixing (`src/utils.py`)**: Uses `pydub`. It applies automatic `0dBFS` normalization, fades, and crucially: when mixing synthesized vocals with the instrumental track, it **ducks the instrumental by -3dB and boosts the vocals by +2dB**. This creates headroom and prevents digital clipping, ensuring clear lyrics.
4. **Dynamic AI Prompting (`src/midi_analyzer.py` & `src/content_generator.py`)**: The pipeline reads the `.mid` file byte-signature using `mido` to extract BPM and Time Signature. It passes this to GPT-4 to act as an expert music producer, creating a 250-character expert prompt for Replicate, rather than just using a generic word like "Deep House".
5. **AI Subtitles & Vocals (`src/content_generator.py` & `src/tts_generator.py`)**: OpenAI (GPT-4) generates estimated timestamps and lyrical lines. This is saved as a `.srt` file. `ElevenLabs` generates the raw vocal audio based on these lines, which are stitched together across a single timeline.
6. **Video Encoding (`src/video_uploader.py`)**: Uses `ffmpeg`. It can either loop a static image downloaded from DALL-E 3, or run a complex `showwaves` visualizer. It securely burns the `.srt` subtitles into the final video. If subtitle burning fails (e.g., font/special char issues), a `try/except` block catches the `ffmpeg` error and attempts to generate the video *without* subtitles to ensure the pipeline doesn't crash entirely.
7. **Cloud Architecture (`src/s3_uploader.py` & `src/webhook_notifier.py`)**: Features native AWS S3 integration via `boto3`. Generated media is uploaded with `public-read` access. Upon completion, a Discord Webhook is triggered featuring a rich embed of the downloaded URLs and MusicGen prompt parameters.

## Database Schema (`src/db.py`)
A local `history.db` SQLite database is maintained.
- `history` Table: `id` (PK), `hymn_name` (TEXT), `style` (TEXT), `video_path` (TEXT), `audio_path` (TEXT), `metadata_path` (TEXT), `remote_video_url` (TEXT), `remote_audio_url` (TEXT), `date_created` (TIMESTAMP).

## Agent Design Rules & Observations
- **Do not alter `max_workers=min(4, len(midi_files))`** in `main.py` without considering API rate limits (HTTP 429).
- **Do not alter `audio = audio - 3`** inside `utils.py` without considering digital clipping when layering heavy bass instrumentals with vocals.
- **Always update `VERSION.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`** when adding new features.
- **Run `python -m pytest hymn_remaker/tests/`** before submitting. Tests use `pytest-mock` to avoid burning real API credits during CI/CD.

## Next Steps for Incoming Model (Gemini/Claude/GPT)
Based on the `ROADMAP.md` and `IDEAS.md`, the pipeline is extremely robust and fully loaded with Cloud integration, Database management, and Dynamic AI prompting.

In this recent cycle, I implemented the `status_callback` deep within `tts_generator.py` to allow line-by-line logging and progress updates to bubble up to the Streamlit UI, replacing the old block update. I also removed an obsolete `midi2audio` dependency and resolved a `datetime.utcnow()` deprecation warning in `webhook_notifier.py`. `src/midi_renderer.py` natively relies on `subprocess.run` to call `fluidsynth` directly, so `midi2audio` was correctly and safely removed. All tests pass locally and the `pytest` suite correctly validates the new parameter passing.

The next recommended frontier is:
1. **Frontend Refactoring:** Porting `app.py` away from Streamlit into a Next.js / React application, while exposing the python logic through a `FastAPI` backend.
2. **Suno.ai / Udio TTS Integration:** Attempting to pivot from ElevenLabs (spoken word/choral TTS) into true generated "singing" by exploring unofficial/official APIs for Suno.ai or Udio.
3. **Submodules Dashboard**: Adding a dashboard tracking version compatibility to `app.py`.

Godspeed. The party never stops.
