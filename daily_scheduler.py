🎵 Track: {hymn}
🎹 Vibe: {genre} / Electronic Worship

{visual} Our visuals are crafted by our creators using multiple digital media tools to deliver the ultimate psychedelic experience.

Every track is meticulously produced using Hymnmania, a custom software automation tool engineered by Bob & Lum to fuse faith, code, and electronic music. We believe psytrance is more than music — its fast, repetitive tempos stimulate the brain's reward pathways and induce a state of deep meditation and stress relief. 🙏🧠
