# Blocked / Removed Hymns & Available Pool

_Last updated: 2026-09-10 (v5.97.19)_

## ❌ REMOVED from the pipeline (do not re-add)

These were moved to `mp3_input/_blocked/` and are filtered by
`scheduler_v2.BLOCKED_HYMNS` so they can never be picked again.

| Hymn | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **O Happy Day** | Suno ACRCloud copyright fingerprint — upload/cover rejected (tried down4, mix3, shift3, shift5) |
| **Kumbayah** | Suno ACRCloud fingerprint — rejected (tried 1.0x, down2, sine) |
| **Brighten The Corner Where You Are** | Suno ACRCloud fingerprint — rejected (tried 1.0x, down2, sine) |
| **Leyenda** (Isaac Albéniz) | Suno ACRCloud fingerprint — rejected |
| **Praise Him! Praise Him!** | Suno ACRCloud fingerprint — rejected |
| **Just Over The Mountains** | Upload passes, but **every generated cover comes out degraded** (spectral centroid ~400–700 vs the 2000+ of a real cover), from every pitch input tried. Not usable. |

> **Note on legality vs. fingerprinting**: these are public-domain 1913-hymnal melodies.
> The block is Suno's third-party ACRCloud matching against *specific existing recordings*,
> not a copyright claim on the composition. It is an external vendor constraint we cannot
> code around. Pitch-shifting does **not** evade it.

### Also unusable
- `Oh_God_Our_Help_1.0x.mp3` — corrupt (2.6 s, expected ~60 s). `Oh_God_Our_Help_0.5x.mp3` is fine.
- `Oh_God_Test.wav` — scratch/test render.

### How to add a new hymn
```bash
# 1. render MIDI -> sine MP3 (the Suno input reference)
python scripts/audio_synthesis_render_midi_to_sine_wave_clean.py --midi "<path>.mid" --wav out.wav
# 2. upload + generate cover, then capture / compose / post
python upload_robust2.py out.wav 3          # prints VERIFIED + clip id
python gen_only.py psytrance <clip_id> "<Hymn Title>"
python cap_cycle.py <cover_clip_id> "generated/<Hymn>_10x_psytrance_A_cover.mp3"
```
Then add the hymn to `PIECES` in `post_to_youtube.py` and `HYMNS` in
`youtube_update_descriptions.py` so titles/descriptions resolve.

**Test first**: upload the sine render and check the script prints `VERIFIED`.
If it prints a copyright match, the melody is fingerprinted — quarantine it and pick another.
